# My personal dotfiles for servers

My personal dotfiles optimised to run on Ubuntu servers.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

    git clone https://github.com/okaufmann/dotfiles-server.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    ./bootstrap

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

Feel free to create an issue on this repo if you have any questions about them.
